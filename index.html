            <p>Named after the Thar Desert, the Mahindra Thar was first introduced in 2010 as a modernized version
                of the Mahindra Legend, which was based on the Mahindra MM540, a vehicle that was in production in
                India since the 1980s.

                The Thar was designed to be a rugged, reliable, and affordable off-road vehicle that could handle
                the rough terrain found in many parts of India. Its design is based on the iconic Jeep CJ series,
                which Mahindra had been producing under license since the 1940s.</p>
